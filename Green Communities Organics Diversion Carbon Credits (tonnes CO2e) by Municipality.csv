[1] GHG reduction credits (“carbon credits”) available for the 2012 reporting year are the sum of all eligible credits since the signing of the Charter.,,,,,,,
"[2] City of Vancouver and Delta are signatories to a Tripartite Agreement on Solid Waste with Metro Vancouver, which stipulates that all their waste",,,,,,,
goes to Vancouver Landfill; therefore their carbon credits are calculated directly using the Organics Diversion Calculator rather than by using the,,,,,,,
Regional Approach (as described in this report).,,,,,,,
